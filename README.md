Dear TA,
If you notice that my repository was pushed late, you would be correct. 
I initially pushed and committed but forgot to delete the .git folder in my frontend folder and it made a whole separate repository thing.
Long story short, I spent several hours after submitting trying to fix the problem. 
I ended up deleting the repository, creating a copy of the project, deleting the .git folder there (it wouldn't let me in the original)
and then recreating the repository under the same name. 
Sorry it's sorta late. It would have been actually kinda early for once but of course this happens lol.
Thanks for understanding :)
You're the best!
